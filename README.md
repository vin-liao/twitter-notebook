**Why bother using google colab?**

As of this writing, I don't have any fancy GPU. All I got is a crappy old laptop, and with the rise of cryptocurrency, purchasing a GPU isn't a viable option. Recently google gave it's K80 GPU computing power for free (!!!) which is a good news for people like me.

**Why jupyter?**

Google colab only supports jupyter for now, probably to stop people from abusing it's free computing power to mine cryptocurrencies.

**Why download?**

Because every runtime, the notebook starts from scratch, everything must be redownloaded and reinstalled. For me this is one of the downside of using cloud computing, but hey it's free, not gonna complain.
